SRB2 Install Instructions

1. Move every file from the "new-install" folder to this main install folder.

2. DELETE "staging.bat" and "staging.txt"! These can mess up your installation if run by accident!

3. Optionally, create a folder in your user profile named "SRB2". This is where your game data and addons may live. For example,

	C:\Users\[User]\SRB2

4. Run the game! Double-click srb2win.exe -- or see if you have Start Menu icons under "Sonic Robo Blast 2".
